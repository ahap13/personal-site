# Personal Site

Link to the live site [here] (https://ahap13.github.io/personal-site/)

Welcome to my personal site! This page is designed to act as a portfolio, giving an insight into who I am, my skills, experience, and projects! I am always open to new opportunities, feedback, and criticism so feel free to reach out!

## What I Used

HTML
CSS
JS

While I have several projects that use additional libraries, I kept the design for this site limited to just HTML, CSS, and JS as I didn't feel the need to use anything beyond that.
